                    cause that they nominated when registering their online account. If a shopper is not currently
                    registered the money raised will go the Shopnate nominated cause of the month.</p>

                <h3>Supply of Products
                </h3>
                <p>We refer you to 3rd party online stores who supply products you can purchase. We do not sell or
                    supply any products directly to consumers </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Consumer Guarantees</h3>
                <p>Under the Australian Consumer Law, consumer guarantees apply. Nothing in these Terms and Conditions
                    nullifies the application of those guarantees. If you are interested in more information about your
                    rights as a consumer, see the Australian Consumer Law website. We do not sell any products on our
                    site, so if you have an issue with an online store, you will need to address your grievance directly
                    with them.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Referral Relationships</h3>
                <p>We have paid referral relationships with the partner stores listed on the Shopnate website. We refer
                    you to our partner stores via a link. These links may be found within partner logos, partner names
                    or shop online buttons. By clicking the links you acknowledge that we have referred you to the
                    partner store. When you purchase a product or complete an agreed transaction, we are paid a referral
                    fee by the partner store. When we are paid the referral fee, we pass on the advertised portion to
                    the cause you have nominated.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Referral Payments</h3>
                <p>In the unusual situation that a Shopnate partner does not make an agreed payment, we will make every
                    reasonable attempt to receive payment from them. Once payment has been received by us, funds will be
                    passed on to the nominated charities. In the case that no funds are forthcoming from the partner, we
                    will be unable to pass on contributions to the nominated charities. We will immediately terminate
                    our relationship with the partner store in question. In the case that a lower amount of funds are
                    received from the partner than expected, the nominated charities will receive a reduced amount that
                    is proportionate to what we have received. Upon receipt of the expected balance, we will pay the
                    nominated charities the remaining amount that was advertised.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
                <p>To the extent permitted by applicable laws, we do not accept any liability for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>loss of income, loss of profits, loss of contracts, loss of data or for any indirect or
                        consequential loss or damage of any kind howsoever arising and whether caused by tort (including
                        negligence), breach of contract or otherwise.</li>
                    <li>any damage or injury of any nature caused by the use or misuse of products purchased after
                        having been referred by Shopnate;</li>
                    <li>errors, mistakes or inaccuracies on the Shopnate website;</li>
                    <li>you acting, or failing to act, on any information contained on or referred to on the Shopnate
                        website and/or any linked website;</li>
                    <li>any unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or personal information and/or
                        financial information stored on those servers;</li>
                    <li>any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Shopnate website; and/or</li>
                    <li>any bugs, viruses, trojan horses or other harmful code or communications which may be
                        transmitted to or through the Shopnate website by any third party.</li>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Payments to Charities and NFPs</h3>
                <p>We will only make payments to charities and NFPs once referral fees have been received from our
                    partners into our bank account. Typically charities will receive payments 6 to 8 weeks after a
                    referred purchase was made.</p>
                <p>We make no promises or representations about the amount of money a cause will receive from Shopnate.
                    This will depend on the efforts of the cause and their supporters and on the nature and amount of
                    products bought after having been referred from the Shopnate website. We will not be liable or held
                    responsible if a cause does not receive the amount of money they were hoping to or expecting to.</p>
                <p>If a cause registers incorrect payment details (such as incorrect BSB or account number), we cannot
                    be held responsible for payments that are made into the wrong account. If you notice that payments
                    are not being received into the correct account, please contact us immediately and we will endeavor
                    to have the payments reversed. If there are bank fees involved in reversing transactions, we reserve
                    the right to subtract these fees from payments made to charities.</p>
